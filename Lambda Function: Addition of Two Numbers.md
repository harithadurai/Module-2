# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
add = lambda a, b: a + b
num1 = 7
num2 = 5

result = add(num1, num2)
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")
```
## Output
The sum of 7 and 5 is 12

## Result
Thus the write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum is verified successfully.
